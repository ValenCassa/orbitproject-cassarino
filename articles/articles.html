        <p>Famous for its fashion, crazy nightlife, incredible art scene, museums, incredible restaurant scene, and world-class theater productions, to me, New York City is the beating heart of the world. Every culture, language, and food is represented here. You could spend a lifetime exploring the city and <span class="highlight">never really see it all.</span><br><span class="img-text">There is a never-ending list of things to do in the city. No amount of time you spend here will be enough so don’t worry about running out of things to do. Whatever you like, you can find it in NYC.
          But, as a budget traveler, visiting NYC can be tough, especially when you don’t know the hidden gems that make living here affordable. There are plenty of things to do that won’t cost you an arm and a leg — if you know where to look! Our first choice is meander throught <span class="highlight">Central Park</span>: it’s free, there are lots of little paths to walk, and, since it spans over 40 blocks, it’s easy to spend hours upon hours wandering around or having a picnic. During the summer months, there are often free concerts and theater productions here too. From the spring to the fall, there are free walks on Saturdays at 11am. But there are a ton of things to do, such as visiting the <span class="highlight">9/11 Memorial </span>or seeing the <span class="highlight">Statue of Liberty.</span></span></p>

      <div class="article-text">
        <p>Known for its counter-culture roots, eclectic music scene, startup tech companies, booming immigration populations, and picturesque views, San Francisco is an exciting city to visit. Here you’ll find hippies, college students, tech giants, artists, immigrant enclaves, and everything in between. I’m always amazed at the diversity of the city.</span><br><span class="img-text">To me, visiting San Francisco is all about the outdoors and the food. You come here to dine on some of the best Asian food in the country, relax in a chill cafe, and then head out to the parks to lounge away the day.

          While it is one of the most expensive cities in the United States, there are still plenty of ways to visit on a budget. These are some of our favourites things you can do in this amazing city: first, you can <span class="highlight">tour Alcatraz.</span>This is a former federal prison on Alcatraz Island. Take a tour to learn about the island’s past and its famous inmates (including mobster Al Capone). Be sure to book the ferry early as it fills up fast. Day-tour tickets cost $41 USD, night-tours are $48 USD, and behind-the-scenes tours cost $90 USD. And second, you can go walk the <span class="highlight">Golden Gate Bridge</span>The Golden Gate Bridge is an engineering marvel and one of San Francisco’s most iconic landmarks. You can walk the 1.7 miles across the bridge, visit the visitor’s center to learn the history of the bridge, or just stare at it from every angle and take a stupid amount of pictures like I did.</span></p>

        <p>Buenos Aires, known as the “Paris of South America”, lives up to its nickname with an overwhelming café culture, grand boulevards, and food scene to rival its European counterpart.<br><span class="img-text">The city is a hot spot for those who love music, food, dancing, and just all-around beautiful, warm, and friendly people.
          Visiting Buenos Aires is an incredible experience. Here you’ll find history, beautiful architecture, verdant parks, quirky book stores, and fantastic nightlife, particularly if you like clubs that open at 2am.
          This is a city that rises late and stays out late.
          When you travel to Buenos Aires, you’ll find the quality of life is very high here and during my stay, I just floated from cafe to cafe, park to park, and wine bar to wine bar! Explore the markets, the many bookshops and cafes, and just relax!
          I especially loved the growing international expat community in the Palermo district. Here are some of the things you can do: visit the <span class="highlight">National History Museum.</span> This palatial building encapsulates Argentina’s history from the 1500s to the early 1900s. Most of the exhibits focus on the Argentine War of Independence from 1810-1818 and the May Revolution which also took place in 1810. It’s open from 11am-6pm and closed Mondays and Tuesdays. You can also go have a look at the <span class="highlight">Recoleta Cementery. </span>It might seem a bit morbid to visit a cemetery for pleasure, but this place is the final resting place of many of the city’s most notable citizens.</span></p>

People are drawn to it by images of pubs, museums, history, attractions, theater, and diverse culture. I mean it’s London. It’s a big name. How can you not go, right?<br><span class="img-text">Visiting London is amazing. I’ve been there multiple times and, with every subsequent visit, the city has grown on me. The more I go, the more wonder I see. There’s always something new to do here.

          The only problem with London is that it’s very, very expensive; it can eat away at your budget if you aren’t careful. Luckily, there are tons of free or cheap things to do in London that can fill your time. Here are some of the things you cand do: first, you have to visit the <span class="highlight">Big Ben and the House of Parliament.</span>Although you can’t go up the bell tower, you can view this Gothic structure from the street and do tours of Parliament (get there early or you can reserve tickets online). Tours of Parliament cost £25.50 ($33 USD). The best view of the tower is from the opposite side of the river near the London Eye. Then you can go visit the <span class="highlight">Tower of London and Tower Bridge</span>Built in 1070 by William the Conqueror, the tower was expanded many times over the years. Weapons and armor were made here and all coins were made here until 1810. Now, it houses the famous crown jewels. The Tower of London’s changing of the guard takes place daily at 9:30pm, and it’s free. Tickets to the Tower are £25 ($32.50 USD).</span></p>

        <p>Madrid is the capital of Spain and its largest city. With electric energy, world-class food, and a wild nightlife that stretches until dawn, it’s a city that shouldn’t be missed. Like its rival Barcelona, Madrid is a city that embraces the night. Dinner doesn’t happen until 9pm or 10pm and the partying doesn’t kick off until several hours after that. It’s a city for night owls; the early bird doesn’t get the worm in Madrid.<br><span class="img-text">Though it’s somewhat sprawling, Madrid’s numerous neighborhoods are perfect for getting lost in, binging on tapas, and drinking sangria. The warmth of the locals and the slowness of the meals will keep you out late as you soak in the city’s pace. If you embrace the late (and long) meals and the late-night partying and live your life of Madrid’s terms you’ll have a much deeper, enriching visit. Some of the things you can do are: strolling <span class="highlight">Plaza Mayor.</span> The Plaza Mayor, which dates to the 15th century, is Madrid’s main square. While walking this plaza, don’t miss Ayuntamiento (the impressive city council building), the Church of San Pedro, San Francisco el Grande Basilica, and Calle de Cuchilleros (a popular place to eat, but expect tourist prices). Then you can go visit the <span class="highlight">Prado Museum.</span> The Prado Museum is one of the world’s greatest art galleries. Its dazzling display of around 20,000 works by the great European masters is housed in an 18th-century building that opened as a museum in 1819. Admission is 15 EUR.</span></p>

        <p>Milan is recognized worldwide for being one of the design and fashion capitals of the world. It’s a major stop for people who visit Italy, thanks in part to being the second biggest airport in the country behind Rome!<br><span class="img-text">Milan has a lot for travelers beyond just fashion. You have the beautiful Duomo and Sforzesco Castle, a 15th-century castle that now houses Michelangelo’s last sculpture. Then there’s Leonardo DaVinci’s The Last Supper, located inside Santa Maria della Grazie church. Milan has no shortage of culture. A lot of locals told me Milan was a city for work not play.I can see that. It’s not Rome or Florence but, in my opinion, visiting Milan is worth a quick trip if you’re passing through to the Italian Alps or other parts of Italy. Here is our top 2 tings to do in Milan: first, go visit the <span class="highlight">Duomo</span>With over 3,500 statues, 135 spires, and five bronze doors, it is not surprising that it took 500 years to complete the Duomo. Take the elevator up to the roof for sweeping views of the city (and maybe the Alps if it’s a really clear day). Taking the stairs costs €13 ($14.50 USD) and the elevator costs €17 ($19 USD). Then you can relax in <span class="highlight">Parco Sempione.</span> Parco Sempione is home to the Sforzesco castle, an aquarium, Triennaler di Milano (a design and art museum), Branca Tower, and a handful of bars and cafes. This is tranquil place to wander for hours or to sit and have a picnic in the grass.</span></p>
